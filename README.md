# Citi Bike Data: Let's take a trip!

It's 2020: the pandemic is rising, people are either unemployed or working from home, and in the city, it's difficult to have a car, and taking a rideshare, public transit, seems grim. Thank goodness for CitiBike! Easy to use and affordable, we will be exploring the age, gender, and income with the people who are using CitiBike in 2020.

## Income
Does the accessibility and popularity of the stations depend on the average household income? The majority and the more popular of the station rental locations seem to  be in zip codes with an average household income of $64,300+ and there are fewer in the zip codes that earn less than $64,300. There is, however, a station that has a higher count of bike rentals in a lower income neighborhood, Sip Avenue Station. This could be due to the lack of bike rental stations within the area compared to the higher income areas with readily available locations.

## Age
Next, we explored if there was a relationship between median age of users and where they lived and if that in a direct relationship with the stations they went to. For the most part, it seemed that the majority of users, which were in their 30s, had no effect on the preference of station that they rented their bikes from.

## Gender
Finally, we explored the disparity between gender and bike usage. For the most part, the majority of users were male, and they were willing to rent bikes from any area, regardless of how populous the area was, it seemed more of a utilization more than anything. Females, however, only rented in more populous areas rather than non-populated areas.
